-- Even Fibonacci Numbers:
-- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by
-- adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2,
-- the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
-- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values
-- do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
